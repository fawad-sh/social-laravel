## About SocialWall

Social wall is a micro post publishing website, where users can register and post micro comments.

It is built using Laravel. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

Setup: Install Laravel on your local system using Docker Desktop and Laravel Sail https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#your-first-laravel-project

- Clone or download the code
- Run composer install and npm install
- Run the database migration
- Register 2-3 users and add some posts
- Run Laravel tinker to add dummy data (App\Models\Post::factory()->times(63)->create(['user_id' => X])
App\Models\Post::factory()->times(110)->create(['user_id' => Y]), replace X and Y with actual user ids from the users table

- Enjoy the app!

Happy programming
